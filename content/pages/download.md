          We strongly recommend installing the app through Google Play so you
          can get automatic updates.


          If you don't have access to Google Play, our friends over at
          [TroubleMaker Shenzhen](https://troublemaker.site/), an international
          makerspace created to help foreign tech startups start their
          businesses in China, have graciously helped us to host the .apk file
          for manual installation.

          Click here to download the .apk installer file!


          If you are viewing this page in WeChat, you may have to open this link
          in your phone's separate web browser app outside of WeChat as WeChat
          does not allow directly installing app files.
